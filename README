A very simple NCBI taxonomy lookup program.
Use as you wish, but please acknowledge that I (Will Pearse) wrote the script in whatever you're doing.

To use, simply make sure you have Python and Biopython installed, then type:

./taxonomyLookup.py --help

to see the options. Make sure you specify a taxonomy file (one taxon per line, please!), an email address, and an output file (that shouldn't exist yet!!!) and you're away!

There's a bundled Mac version up online for you to use as well. Have fun!
